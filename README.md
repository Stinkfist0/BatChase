# BatChase

A WebAssembly and WebGL game based on a Skrolli 2022.3 article by [Jukka Jyl√§nki](https://github.com/juj/).
Art assets from https://github.com/juj/bat_chase. You can play the game at https://stinkfist0.github.io/.

The plan is to

1. implement the game in the article with some modern C++ sprinkled on top
1. do some further development and features on the game
1. start working on an original game based on the learnings
